# Smart-Energy-Grid-
This project applies machine learning to optimize power plant selection in a smart energy grid. Using cleaned demand, plant, and cost data, ensemble models (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting) minimize generation cost, achieving significant error reduction over static baselines.
